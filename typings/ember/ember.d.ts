  export namespace A Suite can be used to define a reusable set of unit tests that can be
applied to any object {
    export namespace   Suites are most useful for defining tests that
work against a mixin or plugin API {
      export namespace   Developers implementing objects that
use the mixin or support the API can then run these tests against their
own code to verify compliance {
        export namespace 

To define a suite, you need to define the tests themselves as well as a
callback API implementors can use to tie your tests to their specific class {
          export namespace 

## Defining a Callback API

To define the callback API, just extend this class and add your properties
or methods that must be provided {
            export namespace   Use Ember {
              export namespace required() placeholders for
any properties that implementors must define themselves {
                export namespace 

## Defining Unit Tests

To add unit tests, use the suite {
                  export namespace module() or suite {
                    export namespace test() methods instead
of a regular module() or test() method when defining your tests {
                      export namespace   This will
add the tests to the suite {
                        export namespace 

## Using a Suite

To use a Suite to test your own objects, extend the suite subclass and
define any required methods {
                          export namespace   Then call run() on the new subclass {
                            export namespace   This
will create an instance of your class and then defining the unit tests {
                              export class  extends Ember.Object {
                              }
                            }
